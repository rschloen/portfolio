# Coming Soon: Surface Electromyography control of a Robotic Hand

The goal of this project is real time control of a robotic hand with surface electromyography (SEMG). I will be using signals acquired using Thalmic Labs Myo armband, Deep Learning for gesture recognition. This project is under development and will be completed in March 2020. Stay tuned for more details!
