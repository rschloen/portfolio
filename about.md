# About J. Robert Schloen
I am currently enrolled in the Master of Science in Robotics program at Northwestern University. I received my Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering at George Washington University in 2019. My main fields of interest are medical and assistive robotics and human computer interaction, with a focus on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and brain computer interfaces.
